Once the script mySysMonitor.sh is run on the terminal as shown above, the mySysMonitor.html file can then be accessed. 
Once the html file is accessed, it will show information of the system as shown on the image above.

At the top of the page, basic information of the system is displayed such as, name of the user, 
the time and date the file was accessed, the number of users, and the load average.

I have used bootstrap framework to allow me to separate the system information into columns. 
The first two columns display the current processes and the disk usage of the system. 
Each of the system information contains a timestamp at the bottom of the column.

The remaining three columns will display, devices that are plugged in on the system, the network interfaces and their states, 
and the users that are currently logged in. similarly, each of the system information has a timestamp displayed at the bottom of the column
